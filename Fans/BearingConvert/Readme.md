We have few of these fans, but unfortunately the lubrication in them stopped working and although I’ve tried 4 different oils and 3 different types of grease I cannot get it to work properly again. It will work for a couple of weeks and then I need to take it apart and oil or grease it again. These are also expensive and I’m tired of buying new ones every few years.

The issue is that the axle of the motor runs inside 2 of these bushings. If well lubricated it should work just fine, but after it ran dry and heated up A LOT I can’t get it to run properly anymore.

Plan is to replace the bushings with bearings, but I can’t get a bearing with the correct inner and outer diameter that will actually fit. I need to make a spacer to fill the gap between the outside of the bearing and the motor housing.

This is the original piece that held the bushing in the housing. I need to drill it out using a hole saw so the bearing can fit inside it.

Unfortunately, the metal is too thin and broke while doing a test fit in the housing.

Plan B is to make a new ring from some 2mm galvanised steel plate. Drilled out in the inside using the hole saw and then used metal snips to get the outside diameter close. Forgot to take some images, but I used a hand file to smooth the outside of the ring and make it just fit in the motor housing.

Assembled the motor with the new rings in place to hold the bearings centred…

This fan has been running on the same bearings since late 2020 and if the bearings start to wear I can just swap out some new ones and keep going.
