So one of our fans stopped working and it seems the motor it self gave up. It was a 75w fan, but because of the thin wire frame it moved quite a bit of air. So now I'm left with this frame...

I have another fan which is 100w, but it's a plastic monster and the thick plastic results in less airflow than the old 75w fan...

First I needed to pull all the guts...

Then I started work on some brackets as the 100w motor doesn't fit the wire frame holes. This was done using a very old pair of metal snips which loves to pinch your fingers between the handles if you are not careful...

I made 2 plates and did a test fit. I then placed the 100w motor on top of the plates and tried to center it as close as I can and marked what I needed to cut out so the motor will fit.

After using the metal scissors, 1 round hand file, 1 flat hand file, and a good old claw hammer it was time to fit the motor. I was able to mark and drill the holes to mount the motor as well.

Now I needed to fit the power/speed control knob somewhere. Lucky for me I was able to just screw it to the rear of the frame. Nice and simple.

Now I needed to box up the rest of the wiring. For this I went with the obvious... a piece of trunking. Cut it to length and take out a piece for the power wire to fit though. I drilled 2 holes in it and bolted the trucking to the wire frame.

Unfortunately the 100w fan blade is just a little bit too big and hits the bolts that holds the frame to the stand :frowning:

Even if I did center it 100% the blade would still hit. O well... I'll just use the blades from the old 75w motor...

And it lives!
