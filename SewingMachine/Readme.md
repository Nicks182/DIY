My grandparents bought this sewing machine new in 1964-ish. At some point it needed some fixing and a custom plug was fitted to it. This shorted out somehow and started to catch fire. Fortunately we pulled the plug from the wall and it stopped. Time rewire it and just get rid of the custom plug.

Some more old and dodgy wiring…

First replaced the top wire and the light is still working.

As I will be adding a new main switch and fuse, I need something to house it along with the new wring. Had some trunking which will do just fine.

Cleaned up as best I could…

Rewired the foot pedal…

Fitted new switch, new fuse, and split the power between the motor and the light.

Used some copper brackets to hold the wire and act a strain relief… and it looks cool…
