The window in my driver's door suddenly started twisting when I tried to close it. Instead of going up level, the window would turn all skew.

The mechanism has 3 contact points that help keep the window upright as the motor pulls it open or close. Two of these points are the sliders right at the bottom and you can still buy these plastic sliders from BMW. The third point on the other hand is a little wheel that runs inside an aluminium track and this part is not a serviceable part. Meaning, it’s not something you can replace… you need a whole new mechanism.

Below you can see that the pin the wheel runs on is not something you can remove. This is attached with the plastic wheel in place during manufacturing. The plastic wheel also has a bunch of cavities which is done to save on manufacturing costs. It might seem stupid, but when you make like 10 million of these parts you can save quite a bit and it’s why this little wheel is not completely solid.

I was not about to give BMW a ton of money for a whole new window mechanism and buying a second hand mechanism might last years or 1 day.

I decided that I was going to try and make this part, grind down the metal pin, drill a hole in the pin, and then fit the new hand made part using a machine screw and some lock tight.

Bought some plastic stock. This is called Acetal and I think it is the same kind of plastic or at least very similar to the original.

Now things get… uhm… interesting. The outer diameter of the stock plastic matches the little wheel, but I needed to carve out some of the plastic to reproduce the step in it. 
1. I cut a piece and then drill a hole through the middle. 
2. I then used a bolt to attach it to my cordless drill.
3. I then clamped a piece of wood with a screw in it to the bench grinder.
4. The screw acts as a stop so I don’t grind away too much and turning the screw in or out allows me to adjust it.
5. I then used some hose clamps to pull the trigger on the cordless so I can keep it spinning at a slow, but constant speed.
6. Then I just grind away and check the width of the step as I go until it’s the same as the original.

After it’s the right size, I use some sandpaper to smooth it out. Last pass I used 600 grit sandpaper and this is what it looks like.

Now I use a grinder to grind the lip of the pin away making sure not to grind away too much.

Placed a piece of wood behind the pin and drilled a hole. I used a 4.2mm bit and here you want to use drill bits meant for metal. It’s usually labelled as “HSS” which stands for High Speed Steel.

Once the hole is done we can tab it and make some threads for the bolt we will be using. The bolt is a 5mm, but that’s to the edge of the threads. Meaning out 4.2mm whole with the threads cut out ends up at 5mm.

Attach the new part and here I used a washer, but there are better options for the little bolt where a washer should not be needed. This is just what I had.

Put the track back with some new lithium grease. The bolt to the right of the track is how you adjust the window. Some tuning here might be needed to get the window 100% vertical.

Alcohol + power tools… what can go wrong…

And it’s working again.
