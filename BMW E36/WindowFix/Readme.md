My rear window in my 1999 BMW 3 series broke the plastic part used to slide the pin that moves the window up or down. It’s the original from 1999… or was…
There's 2 common reasons this happens.
1. The plastic goes brittle and can't handle the strain.
2. The grease gets hard over time making it harder for the plastic part to slide and then the motor will just pull the part into pieces.

This has already happened with the other window and I bought a extra part then so had a spare ready to go…

I did clean as much of the old grease as I could and put new lithium grease in with the new part. You need to apply quite a bit of force to push the metal ball into the plastic part. It needs to clip in and then you can put hte metal retainer in.

Also saw that the little magnet holder gave way. Rust behind the magnet pushed it so far out that the cover fell off and was laying at the bottom of the door. The magnet on the right got stuck to the one of the left. There is a sensor at the top of the door that detects this magnet and it’s how the system knows when the window is all the way up.

Cleaned it and used some glue to put it back together. The magnet is the important part so it doesn’t really matter how I hold it there.

And fixed.
