My rear window in my 1999 BMW 3 series broke the plastic part used to slide the pin that moves the window up or down. It’s the original from 1999… or was…
There's 2 common reasons this happens.
1. The plastic goes brittle and can't handle the strain.
2. The grease gets hard over time making it harder for the plastic part to slide and then the motor will just pull the part into pieces.

This has already happened with the other window and I bought and extra part then so had a spare ready to go…
